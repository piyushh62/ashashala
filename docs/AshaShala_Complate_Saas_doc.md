## Part 1 — Vision Recap

A SaaS education platform where:
- **Only Super Admin role is fixed**; every other role (School Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent, and any future role like Accountant/Librarian) is **dynamically defined per school** — no hardcoded roles in code.
- **CRUD hierarchy cascades naturally**: Super Admin → School → Classes → Teachers (mapped) → Students (mapped) → Parents (mapped) — and *who* is allowed to create *what* is itself a **permission**, not a hardcoded rule.
- **Every role has its own dashboard**, showing only what its permissions allow — dynamically, not a fixed React page-per-role.
- **AI is proactive everywhere**, not just a chatbot: timetable suggestions, schedule-driven learning, auto-reports — always with a human-approval step for anything consequential.
- Currently pre-monetization: **5–10 pilot users, free-tier LLM APIs only**, paid keys added later.

## Part 2 — Current State (Ground Truth, from code)

| Layer | Exists | Confirmed detail |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | ✅ | FastAPI, async SQLAlchemy, Alembic, LangGraph, Qdrant |
| Roles | ⚠️ Hardcoded | `UserRole(str, enum.Enum)` — 5 fixed values in Python |
| Who can create users | ⚠️ Hardcoded | Only `school_admin` role; `_CREATABLE = {teacher, student, parent}` hardcoded set — **teacher cannot create students/parents today** |
| Class/Subject/Enrollment/TeacherAssignment/ParentStudentLink | ✅ | Full CRUD exists, tenant-scoped |
| AI Agents | ✅ (reactive only) | Tutor, Quiz Master, Evaluator, Progress — all triggered by student chat message |
| Orchestrator | ⚠️ | Pure intent classifier (`explain\|quiz\|grade\|progress`), not a supervisor |
| Scheduler/event bus | ❌ | None — no Celery, no APScheduler, no pub/sub |
| Timetable | ⚠️ Manual only | Plain CRUD, zero AI involvement |
| Safety layer | ✅ | Keyword block + subject guard + optional NeMo-Guard jailbreak classifier — solid |
| Notifications | ⚠️ In-app only | No SMS/WhatsApp/email channel field on `Notification` model |
| i18n (frontend UI) | ❌ | No locale files found — UI is English-only even though backend chat is multilingual |
| Audit log | ✅ | Exists, immutable pattern |
| Feature flags | ✅ | `School.features_json` — reusable for optional modules (Fee, etc.) |
| Frontend pages per role | ⚠️ Fixed | Admin (2), School Admin (4), Teacher (4), Student (4), Parent (2) — hardcoded React routes, not permission-driven |

---

## Part 3 — Dynamic Role, Permission & CRUD-Hierarchy Architecture

### 3.1 Schema (replaces the enum)

```sql
CREATE TABLE role_templates (id UUID PK, name TEXT UNIQUE, is_system BOOLEAN, description TEXT);
CREATE TABLE permissions (id UUID PK, resource TEXT, action TEXT, UNIQUE(resource, action));
CREATE TABLE template_permissions (template_id UUID, permission_id UUID, PK(template_id, permission_id));

CREATE TABLE roles (
    id UUID PK, school_id UUID NULL,     -- NULL = platform-level (super_admin only)
    name TEXT, template_id UUID NULL, is_custom BOOLEAN
);
CREATE TABLE role_permissions (role_id UUID, permission_id UUID, PK(role_id, permission_id));
CREATE TABLE user_roles (user_id UUID, role_id UUID, school_id UUID, PK(user_id, role_id, school_id));
```

### 3.2 CRUD Hierarchy — Made a Permission, Not a Hardcoded Rule

Instead of "only School Admin can create Teacher/Student/Parent" being baked into code, model it as data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE role_creation_rights (
    creator_role_id UUID REFERENCES roles(id),
    creatable_template_id UUID REFERENCES role_templates(id)
    -- e.g. School Admin role → can create Teacher, Student, Parent templates
    -- e.g. Teacher role → can create Student, Parent templates (if school enables it)
);
```

This directly fixes your Point 1: whether a **Teacher can create Students/Parents** becomes a **per-school toggle**, not a code change. Tuition-style small schools enable it; larger schools with a dedicated office keep it School-Admin-only.

**Cascading mapping table (what maps to what):**

| Entity created | Must be mapped to | Mapping table |
|---|---|---|
| Teacher | Class + Subject | `TeacherAssignment` (exists ✅) |
| Student | Class | `Enrollment` (exists ✅) |
| Parent | Student(s) | `ParentStudentLink` (exists ✅, but creation locked to School Admin — fix via §3.2 rights table) |

**Edge cases to handle (thought through, not obvious at first glance):**
- One parent → multiple children (already supported by `ParentStudentLink` being many-to-many) ✅
- One student → multiple parents/guardians (same table supports it, just needs UI) — currently unclear if enforced
- Student transferred mid-year between classes → needs `Enrollment` history (currently likely overwrites, not versioned) — **gap**
- Teacher leaves school mid-year → `TeacherAssignment` needs an `end_date`, not hard delete (for audit/history) — **gap**
- Parent consent already tracked (`consent_given_at` field exists ✅) — good for compliance

---

## Part 4 — Dynamic Dashboards (Point 2)

### 4.1 Principle: Sidebar = rendered from permissions, not from role

```
On login → fetch user's resolved permissions (from user_roles → roles → role_permissions)
         → frontend renders sidebar menu items whose required permission is present
         → NO role-name check anywhere in frontend code ("if role == teacher") 
```

This is what makes dashboards **truly dynamic** — add a new "Librarian" role tomorrow with `library:*` permission, and a Library menu item appears automatically for anyone holding it — zero frontend redeploy.

### 4.2 Full page-map (current vs. target)

| Role | Current pages | Target pages (permission-gated) |
|---|---|---|
| Super Admin | Schools, Platform Dashboard | + Role Template Manager, Billing/Plans, Global Audit Viewer |
| School Admin | Structure, Users, Audit, Dashboard | + Custom Role Manager, Fee (if enabled), Admissions inbox |
| Teacher | Materials, Timetable, Dashboard, Flagged | + Student/Parent create (if permitted), Assignment builder, Class-progress page |
| Student | Chat, Dashboard, History, Quiz | + "Today's Learning" feed (Point 4) |
| Parent | Children, Child detail | + Messages, Weekly Report/Digest |
| *(future custom role, e.g. Accountant)* | — | Fee dashboard only — nothing else, by permission |

---

## Part 5 — Full Agent Mesh (Points 3, 4, 5 + governance)

### 5.1 Existing agents (keep as-is, reactive-by-design is correct for these)
Tutor · Quiz Master · Evaluator · Progress

### 5.2 New proactive agents required

| Agent | Trigger | Output | Approval needed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scheduling Agent** (Point 3) | Teacher requests timetable | 2–4 draft options (different trade-offs: workload-balanced vs. subject-clustered vs. room-optimized) | Teacher picks + can edit; re-validated on edit |
| **Scheduled-Learning Agent** (Point 4) | Timetable period starts (cron check) | Topic explainer + 2–3 micro-questions pushed to student's "Today" feed | No approval needed (low-risk, student-facing only) |
| **Reporting Agent** (Point 5) | Weekly/monthly cron | Parent-facing report: mastery trend, quiz scores, attendance, teacher notes — human-readable, not raw tables | Teacher reviews before send (first few cycles), then auto-send once trusted |
| **Communication Agent** | Report ready / at-risk detected | Drafts parent message, sends via enabled channel(s) | Low-risk (digest) auto-sends; high-risk (concern flag) needs teacher approval |
| **Insight/Intervention Agent** | Nightly cron on `ProgressRecord` | "Student X struggling with Fractions 3 weeks running" → alert to teacher | Alert only, no auto-action |
| **Staffing Agent** | Teacher marked absent | Suggests substitute from available teachers | Admin approves |
| **Enrollment Agent** *(optional, if admissions flow built)* | New inquiry submitted | Verifies docs, drafts response | Admin approves |
| **Fee Agent** *(optional, feature-flagged — §9.3 earlier)* | Due-date cron | Reminder draft, defaulter flag | Accountant/Admin approves send |

### 5.3 Agent Governance (the part most teams skip — critical to think through)

- **Confidence scoring**: every agent output carries a confidence/risk score. High-confidence + low-risk (e.g. "send today's practice questions") → auto-executes. Low-confidence or high-risk (e.g. "flag student for intervention", "send fee defaulter notice") → routes to approval queue.
- **Generalized approval queue**: extend the existing `FlaggedAnswer` pattern into a generic `AgentAction` table (`agent_name`, `action_type`, `payload_json`, `confidence`, `status: pending/approved/rejected/auto_applied`, `reviewed_by`). One inbox for *all* agent proposals, not a separate table per agent.
- **Rollback**: any auto-applied action must be reversible (e.g. undo a sent notification's effect, revert a timetable change) — store enough state to undo, not just a log.
- **Audit**: every agent action (proposed, approved, auto-applied, rejected) goes into the existing `AuditLog` — already have the pattern, just extend coverage.
- **Prompt/version tracking**: agents' prompts change over time (already tracked partially via `model_role_used`, `provider_used` on `Message`) — extend this to all new agents so you can measure "did the new prompt version perform better?"

---

## Part 6 — Data Model Additions Needed

| New/changed table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions`, `user_roles`, `role_creation_rights` | Dynamic RBAC (§3) |
| `AgentAction` (generalize `FlaggedAnswer`) | Universal approval queue (§5.3) |
| `Timetable.topic` (new field) | Links schedule slot to a specific chapter/topic, not just subject (Point 4 needs this) |
| `Enrollment.end_date` / history table | Mid-year class transfer tracking |
| `TeacherAssignment.end_date` | Mid-year teacher departure tracking |
| `Notification.channel` (`in_app`/`sms`/`whatsapp`/`email`) | Multi-channel delivery (§7) |
| `Report` (new) | Stores generated parent reports (for history/re-send, not regenerate every time) |

---

## Part 7 — Notification Channels (India-context specific — easy to overlook)

Many parents, especially in rural/low-income school contexts (which AshaShala explicitly targets per its README), **do not reliably use a smartphone app**. In-app-only notifications will silently fail to reach them.

- **SMS fallback** for critical alerts (fee due, at-risk alert, report ready) — cheapest, most reliable reach in India
- **WhatsApp Business API** (very high adoption in India) as a richer channel for reports/digests
- Email as a distant third (many parents won't check it)
- This is a **should-do-early** item — better an MVP with SMS than a polished app nobody opens

---

## Part 8 — Security, Privacy & Compliance (full scenario check)

| Concern | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Tenant data isolation | ✅ `TenantScoped` mixin pattern exists | Keep enforcing on every new table |
| Parent consent tracking | ✅ `consent_given_at` exists | Good — extend to cover new data uses (e.g. WhatsApp opt-in) |
| Data export (right to access) | ✅ `/student/data-export` exists | Extend same pattern to parent/teacher data |
| Data deletion (right to be forgotten) | ✅ Super Admin route exists | Verify cascades correctly across new tables as schema grows |
| India-specific: DPDP Act 2023 (children's data) | ⚠️ Not explicitly addressed | Needs explicit parental-consent-first flow for under-18 data — check against DPDP Act's "Data Fiduciary" obligations for children |
| Content safety (student chat) | ✅ Solid — keyword block + subject guard + optional jailbreak classifier | Keep as-is |
| Agent action audit | ✅ Pattern exists, needs extension (§5.3) | — |
| Rate limiting / abuse prevention | ⚠️ `slowapi` dependency exists but usage not confirmed everywhere | Verify applied to all public-facing endpoints (esp. chat, voice) |

---

## Part 9 — Non-Functional Considerations (often missed)

| Area | Consideration |
|---|---|
| **Accessibility** | Roadmap mentions WCAG 2.1 AA (Phase 5) — currently no evidence of implementation; low-literacy parent UX also matters (icons + voice over text-heavy UI) |
| **Offline/low-bandwidth** | Roadmap flags this as a risk already; voice TTS caching in R2 was planned — not yet built. Rural connectivity means this isn't optional long-term |
| **Localization (UI itself)** | Backend supports multilingual chat; frontend UI strings are English-only — parents/students with low English literacy face a wall before even reaching the AI |
| **Testing/QA** | `pytest` configured (good foundation) — but agent behavior (LLM outputs) needs eval harnesses, not just unit tests, since correctness isn't deterministic |
| **Monitoring/Observability** | `structlog`, `sentry-sdk` present in dependencies — confirm actually wired for the new proactive agents (silent background failures are the top risk of going agentic) |
| **Cost governance dashboard** | `LLMUsage` model exists (good) — extend to per-school budget alerts before scaling past pilot |
| **Disaster recovery** | Not yet addressed — even at pilot scale, a backup/restore runbook for Postgres + Qdrant is cheap insurance |

---

## Part 10 — Business/Extensibility Considerations

- **Open-source + optional modules**: Fee module (and similarly Admissions, HR, Library, Transport later) should follow the same `features_json` toggle pattern — keeps core lean, lets schools/contributors add modules without bloating the base product
- **Plugin-style agent registry**: as agent count grows (8+ agents planned), maintain a simple registry (`agent_name → trigger event → handler`) so adding agent #9 doesn't require touching the orchestrator's core logic
- **Avoid vendor lock-in**: LLM router already abstracts Gemini/NVIDIA/OpenAI — good, keep new agents going through the same router, not calling providers directly

---

## Part 11 — Consolidated Gap Table (everything, in one place)

| # | Gap | Priority | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hardcoded role enum → dynamic role/permission schema | 🔴 Critical | Medium |
| 2 | Role-creation-rights as data, not hardcoded set | 🔴 Critical | Small (once #1 done) |
| 3 | Permission-driven sidebar/dashboard | 🟠 High | Medium |
| 4 | Scheduler (APScheduler at pilot scale) | 🟠 High | Small |
| 5 | Scheduling Agent (AI timetable) | 🟠 High | Medium |
| 6 | Scheduled-Learning Agent (timetable-driven topics + micro-quiz) | 🟠 High | Medium |
| 7 | Reporting + Communication Agents (parent report) | 🟠 High | Medium |
| 8 | Generalized `AgentAction` approval queue | 🟠 High | Small–Medium |
| 9 | Multi-channel notifications (SMS/WhatsApp) | 🟠 High (India context) | Medium |
| 10 | Insight/Intervention Agent (at-risk alerts) | 🟡 Medium | Small (data already exists) |
| 11 | Frontend i18n (UI localization) | 🟡 Medium | Medium |
| 12 | Mid-year transfer history (`Enrollment`/`TeacherAssignment` end dates) | 🟡 Medium | Small |
| 13 | Fee/Admissions/HR/Library modules (feature-flagged, optional) | 🟢 Low (deferred) | Large |
| 14 | DPDP Act explicit compliance review | 🟡 Medium | Small (review + doc) |
| 15 | Offline/low-bandwidth support | 🟢 Low (post-pilot) | Large |
| 16 | Disaster recovery runbook | 🟢 Low (cheap insurance) | Small |

---

## Part 12 — Phased Roadmap (pilot-aware: 5–10 users, free-tier APIs)

**Phase 1 (now → 3–4 weeks): Foundation**
Dynamic RBAC schema (#1, #2) → Permission-driven sidebar (#3) → Generalized `AgentAction` queue (#8)

**Phase 2 (next 2–3 weeks): Infrastructure**
APScheduler (#4) → SMS/WhatsApp notification channel (#9) → `Timetable.topic` field + history fields (#12)

**Phase 3 (next 4–6 weeks): First proactive agents**
Scheduling Agent (#5) → Insight Agent (#10, fastest since data exists) → Scheduled-Learning Agent (#6)

**Phase 4 (next 4 weeks): Parent-facing**
Reporting Agent + Communication Agent (#7)

**Phase 5 (deferred until pilot grows past ~10 users / multiple schools):**
i18n (#11), Fee/Admissions/HR modules (#13), DPDP formal review (#14), offline support (#15), DR runbook (#16), Celery migration if APScheduler hits limits

---

## Part 13 — Immediate Next Step

Recommended build order for the **very next PR**: start with **#1 + #2 (dynamic RBAC schema)** — everything else (dashboards, agents, approval queue) depends on roles/permissions being data instead of code. Doing this first, while you're still at 5–10 pilot users, avoids a painful migration later.
